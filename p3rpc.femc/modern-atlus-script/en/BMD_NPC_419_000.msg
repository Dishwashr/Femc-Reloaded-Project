[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]Me too! Movies kick ass![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]I love them because they're like a microcosm of real life.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]I get depressed too, when I feel like I wasted my money to watch a crappy movie, but...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]That's taking it to the extreme. Kinda freaks me out.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]Is this what people keep talking about? That Apathy Syndrome?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]They all sucked![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]I'm sure everyone else who wasted their money on those turkeys is saying the same thing.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]It's just like one of those action thrillers, you know?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]Whoever stopped that train is a real-life hero![n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]Those guys look so weird... They're all over town.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]If it was a sci-fi movie, it'd be aliens doing it. If it was a thriller, it'd be some secret organization.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]She has red hair and a white, frilled dress... She stands out like a sore thumb.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]But just writing her off as some kind of weirdo doesn't sit right.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]It feels like I'm in a scene from a movie whenever she's there. I kinda like it...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]You know how, in movies, you see bodyguards with tattoos on their arms, and you know they're badass?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]Well, I saw a guy like that in town. His arm was just completely covered in tattoos.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]He wasn't built like a bodyguard, though...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]He was rail-thin... Plus, he wasn't wearing a shirt. Really stuck out from the crowd.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1]A movie's theme song is very important.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]The quality of the movie is greatly affected by whether its theme song is any good or not.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]Which reminds me... Long ago, I heard there was going to be a Gekkoukan theme song.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]I think it was called "Gekkoukan Boogie," or something like that. I heard it was nearly done.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]I want to hear how it turned out, but who the hell names their song "Boogie"...?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]Did you know they usually cut the cicada sounds out when exporting movies or TV to other countries?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]In places with no cicada, when they hear that sound, they think it's just static or white noise.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 419]Why do you think I'm so reluctant to catch movies at the theater during the summer?[n][w][e]
