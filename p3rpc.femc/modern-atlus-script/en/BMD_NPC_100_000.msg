[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 100]Some girls were gossiping about it. That's a rough way to start to the new school year.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 100]The shop will be closed for the duration, so...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 100]I guess that means I don't get paid. *sigh* This month is going to be tight...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 100]I stock up on them every now and then...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 100]Seems like they've [clr 2]been trending on some website[clr 27], and that's why they sell out so quickly.[n][w][e]

[msg MND_018_0_0]
