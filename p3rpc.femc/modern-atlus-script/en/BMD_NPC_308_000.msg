[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Whaddaya think of the girls here compared to your old school?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[f 2 1]What're you talking about?[e]
[f 2 1]They're all cute.[e]
[f 2 1]They're about the same.[e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]I'm talking about how many hot chicks there are! Our school's girls rank pretty high, if you ask me.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Pubescent Student]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]I know, right? Our school has tons of hot chicks.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Pubescent Student]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]So your old school had lots of hot chicks too?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Pubescent Student]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Dude, there are some seriously hot chicks at this school...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Which is great, but it also makes it harder to approach them.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]If there's a girl you wanna date, you gotta be smart about how you talk to her.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]...you're not going after her, are you?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_007_0_0 top]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]I don't think that's a good idea, since she lives in a totally different world than the rest of us.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]I have a feeling that if anyone tries something funny, her bodyguards will break their neck.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Ghosts can be creepy, but they don't have to be, right?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]If there was a ghost that looked like a cute girl, I wouldn't mind being haunted by it.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Well... As long as she doesn't devour my soul or somethin'.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Pubescent Student]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Well, I've checked out all the new first-year girls...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]They're all pretty cute... But the glasses girl in the student council is especially cute, don't you think?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Pubescent Student]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]I saw a girl in a gothic lolita getup in front of the station...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Man, she was so cute, I had to go up and ask her out![n][w][e]
[f 2 1]I said, "Hey, wanna catch a movie or somethin'?"[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]But she didn't even move, except for breathing! She didn't even bother looking my way...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]My ego still hasn't recovered...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Part of me is glad it wasn't me...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]...and the other part is jealous, since I've never had a girlfriend.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Pubescent Student]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]Have any advice... So, I was tryna pick up some chicks the other day at the station, but it didn't go as planned.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]It's hard when a girl has her guard up, huh? Maybe a more honest approach would work better...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Pubescent Student]]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 308]And the best part of the rumor is they were all wearing bathing suits! Is that true!?[n][w][e]
