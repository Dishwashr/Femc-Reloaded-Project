[f 2 1][bup 3 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]Just messin' around. To be honest, this is kind of an apology for the other day.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 3 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]Y'know, back when I blew up at you?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 3 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]One pack of takoyaki ain't gonna make up for it, but it's better than nothin', right?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]
[f 2 1]I already forgave you.[e]

[f 2 1][bup 3 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 15 0 0]And how I pissed her off, but I didn't know what I did wrong? I, uh... think I get it now.[n][w][e]
