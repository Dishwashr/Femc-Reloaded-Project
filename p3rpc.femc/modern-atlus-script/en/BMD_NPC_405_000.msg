[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[f 2 1]I do.[e]
[f 2 1]I don't.[e]
[f 2 1]I dunno...[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]So, you do too?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I don't mean to say it comes true all the time, but sometimes...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Oh...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]You should take it more seriously.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I don't mean to say it comes true all the time, but sometimes...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Yeah, that's right. There's a fortune teller in this club.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Everyone calls her "Den Mother" or "Mama," but...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I heard if she tells your fortune, there's no getting a second opinion. What she tells you will come true.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Why don't you visit her?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]You know that fortune teller? The one they call "Den Mother" or "Mama"?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]She's got a very weird presence... It's like she's in another world.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I want her to tell my fortune, but I don't have the courage to talk to her...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I had Mama tell my fortune, but it's true what they say... Her fortunes aren't like the others.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Everything that came out of her mouth was so abstract...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]She never said anything like, "Be careful of this," or "This will bring good fortune."[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I don't really have any friends... But I'm trying to make some.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]So I asked Mama how I could meet more people.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Her answer was still pretty abstract, but it helped me come up with a solution![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I'll try doing it next time...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Hey, listen to this![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I did what Mama told me, and I made a real friend![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]This is so great![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Maybe I should have my fortune told next time I'm in trouble...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I lost a ring in my room, and the other fortune teller couldn't find it.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]But when I asked Mama, she told me where it was on the first try![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I couldn't believe my eyes when I found it. It felt like a dream...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I saw this outfit at the clothing department that comes in two colors.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]They both looked great...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]But I know that colors can affect your luck, so I couldn't decide.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I'm here to ask Mama which color I should buy.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]That friend I met after Mama told my fortune... I can't seem to get closer to her.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I don't understand. Maybe I should ask Mama for advice...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Whoa, Mama's fortune telling is great![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I did just what Mama told me to, and I found out something new about my friend...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]And now, we're closer than ever![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Incredible... I really look up to that woman.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Fortune Telling Addict]]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I think I'm depending on Mama too much these days.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]There are other people who want to have their fortunes told. I can't hog her all to myself.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I guess for now, I'll stick with the fortunes you get from TV and magazines...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]Those never come true, though.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I'm just interested in fortune telling, that's all. Why does she have to act like that?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I'm just trying to get as many fortunes as possible...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]It's just sound daily planning, you know?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]I asked Mama if she could help me.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 405]She said she can't "see" her, so she can't do anything now...[n][w][e]
