[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 409]I keep hearing about this stuff, but I never get to see it. Is it all just a joke?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 409]That rumor is just getting started! This time, I hear it's about couples![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 409]The culprit must be a single guy... He's jealous of couples, see?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 409]We just barely squeaked by during some big events.[n][w][e]
