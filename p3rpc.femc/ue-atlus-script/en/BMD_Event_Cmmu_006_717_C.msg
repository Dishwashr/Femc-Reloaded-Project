[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]So the other day I recommended the novel I'm reading to a classmate...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]I don't talk to her much, but at the time we were discussing a movie we'd both seen.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]She wasn't too keen on the recommendation and turned me down, though.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]It was because the series looked hard to get into. There are so many volumes.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1]She's missing out.[e]
[f 2 1]Can't really blame her.[e]
[f 2 1]It's about presentation.[e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]If she just gave it a chance, I know she would see how interesting it is.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]The basic premise is about journeying to other planets, and even that by itself already sounds intriguing.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 7 0 0]And the writing is so unique and poetic. I can't help but get sucked in...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 8 0 0]I know. I'd probably feel the same way.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 9 0 0]It's hard for someone to pick up a series that's been going on for so long.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 10 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 0 25 25]Presentation? You mean like, talking in front of a group of people...?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 11 0 0]Hmm, interesting... So you think I should have slides or something to go with it?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 12 0 0]I could probably show them in a room with a projector, orâ€” Wait, that's not what you meant, is it?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 14 0 0]Well, thank you anyways, [nl]-chan. I appreciate you showing interest in that book.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 15 0 0]Okay, I think I'll read a little further myself.[n][w][e]
