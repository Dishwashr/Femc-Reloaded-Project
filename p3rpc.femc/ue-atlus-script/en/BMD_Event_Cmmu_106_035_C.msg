[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]What do you think of switching to running tights? They say it reduces wind resistance.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]We're not dating. She's just a friend from the team.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][vp 1 0 0 7 0 0][f 5 21 0 11]Come on, no need to act all polite in front of her. Just tell it how it is.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][vp 1 0 0 8 0 0][f 5 21 0 11]I'm surprised you could even get such a pretty girl. Maybe I should become a team manager, too.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][vp 1 0 0 11 0 0][f 5 21 0 10]And it's not very attractive for a girl to be so muscular, you know?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 106 2 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 14 0 0]A manager is a busy job. You won't have time to go around sticking gum on people's shoe lockers.[n][w][e]
