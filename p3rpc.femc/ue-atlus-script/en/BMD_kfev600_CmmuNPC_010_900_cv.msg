[f 2 1][bup 108 3 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 3 0 0]I hope it's not anemia... Should we get you to the nurse's office?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 108 3 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 4 0 0]Though, actually, that might be a bit hard for me.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 5 0 0]I guess I'll just tell you. So, I took the exam for the medical school I was hoping to go to.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 6 0 0]...And I failed.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 108 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 7 0 0]I guess this is my first real failure in life. Heheh...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 8 0 0]So starting in the spring, I'll be a student-in-training. I'll have to keep studying hard every day.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 9 0 0]I don't think I did badly, but exams tend to have a luck factor to them, too.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 10 0 0]I gave it a pretty good effort, I think. I just started studying too late in the game.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 12 0 0]The old me would've just given up. I don't exactly have the strongest willpower.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 13 0 0]But now it's a different story.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 14 0 0]I want to be a doctor and save as many lives as I can. I want to protect the people I love.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 108 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 15 0 0]There are a lot of different ways I can accomplish that.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 108 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 4 16 0 0]And the way I want to do it is through the power of healing.[n][w][e]
