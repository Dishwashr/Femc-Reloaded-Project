[f 2 1][bup 101 0 65535 65535 0 0]The rest of my family's out today. Kinda didn't want to eat all by my lonesome, y'know?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 101 0 65535 65535 0 0]That's when I remembered you eating ramen like it was your favorite thing ever! Great minds, yo.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 101 0 65535 65535 0 0]I don't trust people that don't enjoy their food.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 101 0 65535 65535 0 0]I mean, it's one thing if the food's really nasty.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 101 1 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 101 1 25 25]Then there's those guys that pretend it's good even if they don't like it. Can't trust them either.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 101 1 65535 65535 0 0]I just can't stomach probably like half the food in the world. I don't even consider them edible.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 101 1 65535 65535 0 0]Oh, but if a gorgeous girl was the one cooking, I might be able to. That's different, y'know?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 101 0 65535 65535 0 0]I just can't stand some stuff, personally.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 101 0 65535 65535 0 0]Like vegetables. They're pretty much just leaves. I'm not a bug, ya know...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 101 0 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 101 0 25 25]I mean, mushrooms are just fungus, right? Seafood's kinda pushin' the limits too...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 101 0 65535 65535 0 0]And I hate stuff like ginger and beefsteak plants. Why in the world would you eat roots and leaves?[n][w][e]
