[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 321]Isn't it a pain having to reply to messages from people you don't care about?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 321]I don't really care about other people, but if it's a mystery like this, I get pumped.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 321]Like I can't rest until I get to the bottom of it.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 321]Three days in a row, we've had students at this school passing out. It's a hell of a mystery.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 321]I'm itching to know more... I should try looking into it.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 321]So my investigation isn't going very well.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][f 5 21 1 321]Partly because all their friends were those thugs...[n][w][e]
