[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 3 0 65535 15415 0 0]Let's see, I averaged two hours of overtime... Now factor in the mean age...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Add a little spice here, here, and here...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]According to my extrapolations of next year's salary here... I can expect a 4.17% increase.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]...Huh? Wait a second, if I round up... then I actually get 5.17%![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Um...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Well, in any case, this is one beautiful equation...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 3 0 65535 15413 0 0]Oh, hello there, [nl]-san. Did you overhear my calculations?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Isn't my use of pi in that equation a daring move?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Sure, it may not have been strictly necessary, but it's a question of elegance![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Even Masamune himself would be impressed.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Oh, uh... Guess Mr. Ono's been rubbing off on me.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 3 0 65535 15422 0 0]I assume you're here because you've discovered the beauty of math, right?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Once you master its brilliance, even winning the lottery is a breeze.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Just calculate the probability from all sides... And determine the precise collection totals, too.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Then if you calculate how much of your winnings you ought to save, you'll always make a profit![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 1085 0 65535 65535 0 0]Not that I've ever bought a ticket...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1]I listened to the secret behind[n]falling in love with math...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1]Mr. Ono doesn't seem to be returning.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]I decided to give up for today.[n][w][e]
