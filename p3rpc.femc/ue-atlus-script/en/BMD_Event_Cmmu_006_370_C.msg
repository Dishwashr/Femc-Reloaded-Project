[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]I was curious about how the series would end since it suddenly switched publishers.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 1 25 25]I'm just glad I finally got to finish it. Thanks for coming, [nl]-chan.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 0 25 25]To be honest, I can't stand touching raw fish. They're kinda slimyâ€”and stinky too...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]Plus, I'm clumsy with a knife...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 1 25 25]But maybe I could learn by example. Would you show me how to do it next time?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 4 65535 65535 0 0]But I thought you had Home Economics?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 3 25 25]I'm actually pretty clumsy with a knife, so I can't even fillet a fish myself.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0]How am I going to get better at cooking if I can't learn basic knife skills...?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 0 25 25]Well, I guess there are plenty of other cheap and tasty dishes to choose from these days.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 1 25 25]I think I'll buy some ingredients before heading home. Maybe I could get some vegetables that are in season.[n][w][e]
