[f 2 1][bup 2 1 2 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 10 0 0]To see Junpei. They've been hanging out a lot ever since the school trip.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Yukari Takeba]]
[f 2 1][bup 2 6 2 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 16 0 0]Come to think of it, he did hit on Mitsuru-senpai the first time he met her.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Fuuka Yamagishi]]
