[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]I wonder what that exactly means. The core fanbase for the sci-fi genre can get pretty picky...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]It's the ones who answer like you that turn out to be the hardcore fans.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]Oh... But even if you aren't familiar with the genre, I think this series hooks people pretty easily.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 7 0 0]Apparently, a lot of people get into sci-fi after they read this.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 14 0 0]Um, if you don't mind... do you think we could read here again sometime?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 15 0 0]I used to think reading was only a solo activity.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 16 0 0]But now, I think reading with someone helps me immerse myself deeper into the fictional world.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 19 0 0]So the other day I recommended the novel I'm reading to a classmate...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 20 0 0]I don't talk to her much, but at the time we were discussing a movie we'd both seen.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 21 0 0]She wasn't too keen on the recommendation and turned me down, though.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 22 0 0]It was because the series looked hard to get into. There are so many volumes.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_010_0_0 top]
[f 2 1]She's missing out.[e]
[f 2 1]Can't really blame her.[e]
[f 2 1]It's about presentation.[e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 24 0 0]The basic premise is about journeying to other planets, and even that by itself already sounds intriguing.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 25 0 0]And the writing is so unique and poetic. I can't help but get sucked in...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 26 0 0]I know. I'd probably feel the same way.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 27 0 0]It's hard for someone to pick up a series that's been going on for so long.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 30 0 0]I could probably show them in a room with a projector, orâ€” Wait, that's not what you meant, is it?[n][w][e]
