[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0]Maybe it's just me, but getting called "cute" feels a little patronizing.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 106 1 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 106 1 25 25]But I know you don't mean it like that, so I'll take it as a compliment.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 106 2 65535 65535 0 0]What do I look like, a grandma? Geez, you'd think I was wearing a pantsuit... "Mature"...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 106 1 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 106 1 25 25]I guess I don't usually hang around people who say nice things to each other off the cuff... Thanks![n][w][e]
