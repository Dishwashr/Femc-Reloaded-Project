[f 2 1][bup 2 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]First off, let's talk about how this rumor got started.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 2 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 7 0 0]The girl was found on the school grounds, so it does match the ghost story on that point.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yukari Takeba]]
[f 2 1][bup 2 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 8 0 0]But why did the rumor spread so fast, if this was the first time anything happened?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 2 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 13 0 0]But yeah, I was surprised when I found out.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 2 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 14 0 0]After that first incident, the exact same thing happened to two other students.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 2 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 15 0 0]All three victims had to be hospitalized. No wonder people thought it was a ghost.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 2 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 18 0 0]But they did have one thing in common. Anyone know what it was?[n][w][e]
