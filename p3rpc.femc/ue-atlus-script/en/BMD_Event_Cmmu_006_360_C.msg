[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 3 0 65535 5002 0 0]Did you know part of the Kirijo name comes from the character for "paulownia tree"?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]I looked online, and since this mall belongs to the Kirijo Group, it was actually named after them.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]I think the Kirijo Group is also the parent organization of our school.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]Interesting, huh?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 3 0 65535 5075 0 0]There's something I want to ask you...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]I was talking to the owner of Aohige Pharmacy about cooking...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 3 25 25]And he told me to try using dried snake meat as an ingredient... Can you believe that?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 0 25 25]Um... If I did make a dish with dried snake meat, would you still eat it, [nl]-chan?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_003_0_0 top]
[f 2 1]Sure I would.[e]
[f 2 1]You don't have to.[e]
[f 2 1]It's up to you.[e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 4 65535 65535 0 0]But, if you really want me to, then...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 6 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 6 25 25][f 4 25 6]......[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 6 65535 65535 0 0]...I'm sorry. I don't think I can do it. The thought of touching a snake, dead or alive, is terrifying.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1]Fuuka seems to be having fun.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]I learned a little more about her today.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0]I was worried you'd say that you want to try it...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 6 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 6 25 25]I don't think I could cook snake meat, honestly... I'd be too afraid to touch it.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1]Fuuka seems relieved.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]I feel like we became a lot closer today.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0]I mean, have you ever seen dried snake meat!?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0]It has the texture of a Shadow, and it's the size of a hose on a fire truck...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0]There's no way I'm bringing something like that back to the dorm with me! I can't even bear to touch it![n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 3 0 65535 5061 0 0]What's another ingredient that could substitute snake meat? Eel, maybe?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]But the texture might still feel too similar to a snake. I don't know that I could bring myself to touch that either...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 1 25 25]Maybe I could find some options at a fish market. Do you want to come with me, [nl]-chan?[n][w][e]

[msg MND_011_0_0]
[f 2 1]We went shopping for ingredients[n]before returning to the dorm.[n][w][e]
