[f 2 1][bup 106 3 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 106 3 25 25]I wanted to give the punching machine a try, but the line's gotten so long I'd rather not...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 106 0 25 25]Let's come back when it's less packedâ€”[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 106 1 65535 65535 0 0]Look! It's so cute! Plus... we might be able to get it in one shot.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 106 1 65535 65535 0 0]It's been a while since the last time I've played. I may not look it, but I'm pretty good at these.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 106 0 25 25]If grabbing it doesn't work... I'll just have to slowly shift its position till it drops.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_3_0 [Yuko Nishiwaki]]
[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0]It's kind of a pain, but slow and steady wins the race.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0]Same thing with sports, right? People who are dedicated to training become world-class athletes.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_5_0 [Yuko Nishiwaki]]
[f 2 1][bup 106 1 65535 65535 0 0]Oh... Kinda went on a tangent there. Anyway, let's give this another shot![n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 106 3 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 106 3 25 25]Ugh... Guess I just have to slowly adjust the position till it falls.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_3_0 [Yuko Nishiwaki]]
[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0]In the end, slow and steady wins the race... even though it's a total drag.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 106 0 65535 65535 0 0]But it's the same with sports. People who are dedicated to training become world-class athletes.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_5_0 [Yuko Nishiwaki]]

[f 2 1][bup 106 1 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 106 1 25 25]If I just keep nudging it in the right direction... I should be able to knock it down.[n][w][e]
